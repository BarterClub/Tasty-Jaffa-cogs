## TempVoice cog

### List of the commands and how to use them  


***


* voice [name]
* * Creates a Voice channel named after the user who called it or by the optional parameter [name] - must have `"` around it in order for it to use the whole name (some limitations such as length apply)
* setvoice 
* * channel <channel_id>
* * * Adds which voice channel it should look at which it will move people out of to make a new channel for
* * role <name or ID> <The actual role name or role ID>
* * * Sets the role which can use the commands/make temporary voice channels -- example - `[p]setvoice role name autovoice`
* * voicetype <mode_number>
* * * Sets the mode type for the cog per server. This allows for "on joining a channel, it will make a new one" to useing the command `[p]voice [name]` mode numbers are --- ```1 - use of channel, 2 - use of command``` Default is mode 2
