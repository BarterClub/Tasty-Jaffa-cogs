# The cogs

### pswdchannel
This cog requires bcrypt, Pymongo and can be CPU intensive! It allows admins of servers to add passwords to channels.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs pswdchannel`

### rolenotifier
Allows you to set notification messages that will be sent to the user when a user gains that role.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs rolenotifier`

This will send a custom notification message to anyone who gets that role!

### tempvoice
This cog allows for the creation of temporary voice channels. These channels, once empty, will be deleted.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs tempvoice`

This cog also allows for admins to set a channel, which upon someone joinng, will create a new channel following a customisable format!

### Say
This cog allows servers to permit users to use a fun command "speak". This means that people who are permitted can bet the bot to repeat whatever it wants. This can be set to be used with role or even individual users.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs say`
